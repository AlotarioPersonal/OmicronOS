# OmicronOS
A mock old computer operating system I made.

I came up with this idea after my experience with some older computers, like the Apple II and some IBM PCs.I wanted to create something with a similar style, but I wanted to add a little bit more... functionality to the project.

A lot of people's first reactions were "so, like the virus?"
And, no. No, not really.

It's really evolved into kind of it's own thing.
