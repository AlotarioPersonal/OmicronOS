# OmicronOS
A mock old computer operating system I made.

I came up with this idea after my experience with some older computers, like the Apple II and some IBM PCs.I wanted to create something with a similar style, but I wanted to add a little bit more... functionality to the project.

A lot of people's first reactions were "so, like the virus?"
And, no. No, not really.

It's really evolved into kind of it's own thing.

Upon 1.0.0 release, omicronOS is planned to have the following features:
-multiline system command execution
-omiZone will be a fully interactive environment with actual function
-live date and time readouts for your local timezone
-fully reworked four-function calculator
-audio-playing system

Remember, omicronOS is meant to be a side-by-side PARTNER with your operating system, rather than a full replacement. It should be working in tandem with you and your OS, not doing all the work for you.
