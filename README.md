# OmicronOS
A mock old computer operating system made for things like film production.

I came up with this idea after my experience with some older computers, like the Apple II and some IBM PCs.I wanted to create something with a similar style, but I wanted to add a little bit more... functionality to the project.

Still a WIP.
